                The project is run by the NASA (Necessary Aerospace Survey Administration).
                NASA has work for the Project X for a long time. Project X is a milestone in NASAâ€™s history.
                It shows NASA's vision. It's about why it been set up.<br>
                We are going to build a spaceship that condenses the wisdom of all mankind and is equipped with the most
                advanced
                aeronautics technology. It is a 200km radius, gigantic spaceship with a complete
                ecological cycle build inside. It
                means the passengers can live on the ship for their whole life and procreation generation after
                generation. And the ship has eternal energy. It will never run out. <br>
                But the rule is the ship will never
                turn back to the earth due to the mission of explore the deep space. <br>
                You can explore the universe in their whole life. You will reach the space that human astronauts never
                reach. Thanks to the ecosystem built inside, the ship can provide similar experience like it on the
                Earth. It still has interesting part worth to explore. Also, it allows crews to explore some planet
                using the small-scale sub exploration spacecraft.<br>
                This project is a long term non-ending project, you can see it as a holiday without end or as a great
                adventure. Either way, we welcome you to join us.
                It is currently 2077 and the spacecraft is expected to be launched in Houston in 2998.
