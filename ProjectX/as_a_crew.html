                You have to fight for the survival of this ship and contribute your strength.<br>

                    <li>Before sailing, we invited leading legal experts to draw up a set of spacecraft laws with
                        reference to the laws of various countries. When you board the ship, you are deemed to have
                        known the existence of the laws and voluntarily abide by and accept legal responsibility for
                        responding.</li>
                    <li>We are committed to creating a class equal society. The administrative work of the ship will be
                        co-ordinated and handled by the artificial
                        intelligence AXL6000, which has the highest authority of the ship. The ship's society will
                        operate in a leaderless form (or rather without human leaders).</li>
