            Based on
            the issues related to user experience and community development that we identified in the pet community
            through Ouah Ouah Friends,
            I proposed my own design solution.
            <div class="paraspace">
                <ul class="peticon">
                    <div class="bold">Problem Space</div>
                    <li>Lack of motivation to join the pet community.</li>
                    <li>Uncontrolled environment in the pet community.</li>
                    <li>The quality of information within the community cannot be guaranteed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            Due to the limited design timeframe of only one week, a process similar to agile development was adopted for
            this project. The goal was to complete one round of iteration within the limited time.
        </section>
        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">UX Design</h4>
            <div class="statement">A solution that can facilitate the target audience to join or help them form and
                maintain a pet community. The answer should also effectively sustain the community's environment and
                information quality. </div>
            <div class="statement">The solution is Pet GO, an AR social metaverse based on location-based service. With
                the mobile
                app, users can easily connect with other pet owners in the virtual world, chat and make new friends.
                Users can access a wealth of information about pets and the community.
                Users can create posts and host activities based on location in the app, building a real-world network
                that helps
                pet owners in the local area more easily participate in community.
                <div class="paraspace">
                    Users can open the camera using AR to access users & their pet
                    profiles for quick offline dating information sharing. By quickly connecting people in physical
                    locations to virtual spaces, PetGO helps users make friends and maintain relationships conveniently
                    through online networking.
                </div>
                The metaverse also sets up virtual items to build the reward mechanism. Users
                can earn virtual items through activities, and the proceeds of virtual goods can support the operating
                expenses of the metaverse. Designing a reward mechanism based on gaming principles can help connect the
                sense of community participation with the pleasure of playing games, encouraging users to engage in
                community interactions actively. Moreover, the mechanism can also help maintain the community
                environment and ensure information quality.

                <span class="bold">-Real World: </span>The Skeuomorphic design brings a sense of reality to the virtual
                world, allowing users to perceive the community's connection visually. The design style also helps users
                become familiar with the app more quickly, reducing users' sense of unfamiliarity.<br>
                <span class="bold">-Cartoon: </span>The cartoon UI style can give the app a game-like interface,
                creating a relaxed and entertaining atmosphere for users. It can increase the app's usability and
                improve the social atmosphere.

            After completing the conceptual design, I invited two target users and one expert user to participate in
            card sorting. Based on the results, I finished the interaction and task flow design. Below is the final
            version of the sitemap.

            <h4 class="subtitleofp">UI design</h4>
            Based on the goal of gamified design, the UI adopts a 3D cartoon style, and the interactive elements and
            icons within the application are also designed with a consistent style.

            Three participants participated in the evaluation. One is a peer with a game interaction design background,

            and the think-aloud protocol.
            <img src="./Images/PGtestshot.png" alt="the picture of peer test" class="imgofp img1">
            For the design purpose of the app, gamification design is used to attract potential users to join the
            community and allow them to have long-term support from the community. <span class="underline">All three
                users think that the app's
                gamification is sufficient and it's helpful to achieve this goal</span>. Both potential users said they
            were
            motivated to join the game and keep playing it. They believed the game was relaxing and not heavily
            addictive, and they were delighted to see this.
            <div class="paraspace">
                For usability, professional users said, <span class="underline">"clear hierarchy, consistent and high
                    aesthetic UI design", but
                    she also said there could be a task system in the apt to give the user more guidance and a sense of
                    achievement in the game</span> . She also believes the AR system could be very good at discovering
                the
                connections between existing networks and the pet community. Both potential users say the app is easy to
                use. They thought the flame metaphor was not intuitive, but it was easy to understand its meaning as
                long as they tried. Moreover, they thought dressing up in avatars was attractive, and <span
                    class="underline">the rewards
                    mechanism successfully caught them</span>.
            </div>
            For the privacy issue, all three testers believe that as long as the right of choice is fully open to
            and controlled by the user, this will not cause doubts about the use.
            <div class="paraspace">
                From the comprehensive feedback
                analysis, the current app functions have <span class="underline">achieved the design purpose</span>.
                There is room for improvement in
                details, such as Match between the system and the real world. Suggested functions in the evaluation may
                better increase the role of the app in enhancing the community experience.
