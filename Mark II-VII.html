        <section class="headintroduction">
            Mark &#8545;-&#8550; is a prototype of interactive clothing, a project that explores the possibilities of
            self-expression beyond fast fashion. We defined Mark &#8545;-&#8550; by exploring the intersection of three
            areas:
            self-expression, fashion, and wearable technology. <br>
            Mark &#8545;-&#8550; uses dynamic light to allow people to enjoy self-expression, bring interaction to the
            clothing and promoting a new level of individualism in fashion, . <br>
            The essential interaction of Mark &#8545;-&#8550; has three parts, changing appearance, RFID token,
            and interaction between users.

            <br>*Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the project was completed in a Hybrid mode.
        </section>
        <section class="introduction firstsentence">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">The background</h4>
            Our team, Flash Studio, designed under the theme <span class="italic">Expressable</span>, a subtheme
            under <span class="italic">The Future Everyday: novel interactions for near-future technologies</span>
            and definition of the subtheme <span class="italic">Expressable</span> as:
            <ul class="M2icon">
                <li>Merge of Neo-Fashion and Expressions of Self</li>
                <li>Worn items for self-expression</li>
                <li>Changeable/adaptable fashion</li>
                <li>Enhances / augmented worn garments</li>
                <li>NOT fit-bits, smart-watches, functional things</li>
            </ul>
            The definition of the theme led us to think about the field of self-expression, fashion and wearable
            technology.
            Our understanding of the theme is to integrate technology beyond the "wearable tech" concept
            and put it at the service of fashion expression. Using "fashion" as a novel means of expressing our
            individuality. <br>
            <div class="paraspace">
                <span class="underline">The literature review reveals that many works explored fashion design in the
                    context of interpersonal
                    and
                    intrapersonal expression</span>: Civilisation has advanced from treating clothing as merely
                functional piece of
                defence against the elements, to intricate items that also provide humans identification, modesty,
                status
                and adornment. With this development, fashion became the first <span class="underline">“Social
                    Interface”
                </span>- a means to reflect the
                self.
            </div> Additionally, clothing also affects the wearer's moods and attitudes. The works revealed
            that clothing
            serves as an important form of communication, influencing others and the self.
            As fashion is considered a “social interface”, integrating technology could open up new modes of interaction
            with such interface. In fact, there have been a lot of attempts in this field.
        </section>
        <section class="introduction firstsentence">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Ideation</h4>
            After completing the background research, we conducted several brainstorming sessions to ideate and refine
            the concept. We first discussed which <span class="underline">interaction medium</span> to perform the
            interaction. Temperature, sound and touch etc., were senses we thought of as ways to interact. The
            light was our final thought, as it is a universal medium that is striking, light as a communication medium
            can impact the space where the user is located, and the users can passively
            express their personalities.
            <img src="./Images4/M2brainstorm1.png" alt="Brainstroming note" class="imgofp img1">
            <img src="./Images4/M2brainstorm2.png" alt="Brainstroming note" class="imgofp img2">
            Based on the social properties of clothing,
            We hoped to evolve beyond the passive interaction of clothing into an active interconnection between the
            wearer, observer and garment. Therefore, we considered interpersonal interactions. <div class="paraspace">In
                a sketching session, we thought of distance sensors
                or other
                short-distance connection techniques that would trigger pattern or colour changes through conditions
                such as
                movement or touch when two wearers meet. To help build stronger social connections between users.</div>
            Inspired by existing products, technology enables direct user inputs to affect clothing cryptically and
            personally, reflecting the garment's monetary value.
            <img src="./Images4/M2sketch1.png" alt="idea sketch" class="imgofp img2">
            <img src="./Images4/M2sketch2.png" alt="idea sketch" class="imgofp img2">
            Relate the premium value of clothing and the importance of uniqueness in
            self-expression, it connect us to a bigger picture.The booming NFT industry and the related trading
            market allowed new insights into enforcing uniqueness of digital things. Since Mark &#8545;-&#8550; is
            a non-static interactive garment, treating individual patterns like NFTs can introduce peer-to-peer
            clothing purchases - a new
            form of social experience. It was an exciting idea.
            <img src="./Images4/M2refinement1.jpg" alt="idea renfining note" class="imgofp img2">
            <img src="./Images4/M2refine2.png" alt="idea renfining note" class="imgofp img2">
            <div class="paraspace">
                After refining and perfecting the idea, we identified three main functions of the MarkII-VII:
                <ul class="M2icon">
                    <li>Changing of appearance</li>
                    <li>Tradable token associated with one piece of unique design</li>
                    <li>Interactions occur between jacket wearers</li>
                </ul>
                In communicating with the teaching team, the idea of NFT was so far ahead of its time and technically
                tricky that it exceeded the course requirements and the technical assistance the teaching team could
                provide, so we kept the NFT part in our concept. Prototyping uses the idea of physical tokens.

            In addition to being technically easier to implement, the concept of physical tokens is also more relevant
            to the current physical transactions in the apparel market, providing a more familiar experience for
            consumers and helping with the future promotion of the project.

            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Target Users</h4>
            While fashion is a universal form of self-expression regardless of demographic, socially-conscious young
            adults born in 1995-2010 would be the ideal match for the Mark &#8545;-&#8550;.
            Generation Z is an emerging demographic currently taking up 41% of the population, meaning technologies for
            this demographic will certainly see wide-use and large-scale social effects. Market research has also shown
            that this generation values self-expression more than ever and prefers sustainable and ethical products.
            <div class="paraspace">
                As the first generation to live in a world of ubiquitous technology, generation Z embraces a strong
                sense of
                self-identity, especially online. Consistency and customizability come to mind when observing their
                preferences for platforms and technology (Bewicke, 2021).
            </div>
            The Mark &#8545;-&#8550; is highly suitable for generation Z because it aligns with their core values and
            desires.
            This technology would be highly appealing due to its customizability and uniqueness, that off-the-rack
            clothes cannot provide. It also has other side appeals, such as sustainability and ethical production.

            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Implementation</h4>
            Following our functional design, Mark &#8545;-&#8550; can be broken down into its primary components:
            <ul class="M2icon">
                <li><span class="bold">Light Source:</span> We had chosen NeoPixels for our light source as the most
                    practical and available
                    resource. We experimented with different light diffusion behaviours and colour algorithms to create
                    pleasing and meaningful combinations. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Physical Token:</span> The physical token had to be a component that could
                    generate and store a unique
                    colour combination. Based on workshop resources and teaching team advice, we removed the token
                    trading system and opted for a physical RFID token scheme. Each <span class="italic">'seed'</span>
                    is unique, which coincides
                    with our concept of non-fungible tokens and is, therefore, well suited for our technology
                    application.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Proximity Sensing:</span> Interpersonal interaction was a barrier. Bluetooth and
                    ESP were plausible
                    solutions, but the difficulty was how sensors could detect other Mark &#8545;-&#8550;s without
                    interference.
                    In many conversations with the teaching team, we found that wireless communication was greatly
                    beyond our prototype scope. Additionally, with universal proximity sensors, the boundaries of
                    interaction will no longer be limited to Mark &#8545;-&#8550; users. It can be the interaction with
                    the
                    surrounding. The sensor solution helps open up more opportunities for interaction. </li>
            </ul>

        <section class="introduction firstsentence">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">User Test</h4>
            The main purpose of the user testing was to justify the types of colour palettes used in the jacket was
            reasonable and capable of mobilising the user's emotional changes. We expect to be able to determine if the
            physical experience met our expectations and vision. Even with great resources on colour psychology, we
            believe user testing is worthwhile.
            <div class="paraspace">
                We set up a dark room, illuminated the room with a single colour (or series of colours in our colour
                palettes), and invited testers to express the thoughts and emotions they experienced. We used these
                results
                to select well-liked colour combinations that expressed interesting emotions.
