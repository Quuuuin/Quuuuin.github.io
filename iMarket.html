            iMarket is a design system that improves the traditional market's navigation and functional layouts by
            introducing a new shopping style that improve the traditional market layout into different areas based on
            the types
            of vendors. <br>Traditional markets are dense shopping areas for agricultural and marine products, meat,
            clothes, and retail goods. They have layout issues in which different types of vendors like meat, vegetable
            and marine products are mixed. Accordingly, customers might lose their way and cannot quickly find the
            vendors they want. The system helps users plan shopping routes and reduce time on finding vendors.

        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Background</h4>
            The theme of research and design is <span class="underline">"Encourage collaboration between
                people"</span>. We were asked to design
            site-specific technologies that promote collective experiences for certain groups of people at a site.
            We formed a team of four because we had chosen similar locations in our previous independent research.
            <div class="paraspace">
                During our first team studio meeting, we shared the results of our previous independent study and
                discussed
                the target site for our upcoming design. Combining the dataset from team members about observation and
                interviews in the traditional market in their previous research. After discussion, refinement, and
                extraction of the data, we summarised the following design opportunities:
                <ul class="marketicon">
                    <li style="font-weight: normal; font-family:Helve;">Traditional market vendors are scattered, and
                        navigation systems are lacking.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal; font-family:Helve;">Problems with food hygiene and safety exist in
                        traditional markets.</li>
                    <li style="font-weight: normal; font-family:Helve;">There is a lot of plastic pollution in
                        traditional markets.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            We
            brainstormed
            many initial ideas for the design opportunities and discussed them with other groups.

            <ul class="marketicon">
                <div class="bold">Research Method</div>
                <li style="font-weight: normal; font-family:Helve;">Observation</li>
                <li style="font-weight: normal; font-family:Helve;">Interview<span class="italic">(3

                        participants were covered)</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="paraspace">
                Based on the analysis of the collected data, we found that the scattered layout of vendors and poor
                functional design cause the most significant impact on the customer experience in traditional markets.
                The proportion of affected users is also the largest.
            </div>
            Therefore, we decided to focus on the design opportunity of navigation and functional layout in traditional
            markets. According to the research results, this issue usually affects new customers in the market, so our
            <span class="underline">target users</span> will be focused on new customers who come to the market for the
            first time or those who have no
            experience purchasing from a traditional market.

            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Design-Timeline</h4>
            We follow the design process of empathise-define-ideate-prototype-test to carry out our design work.
            <br>*Indeed, the design process is not linear. We went through many iterations during the design process.
            However, for clarity, I will present the decisive design process linearly.

        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Design-Empathise</h4>
            Based on the data we collected during the research phase, we created an empathy map to visualise user needs
            and reveal the critical problems that the users face.
            <div class="paraspace">We divided the map into four quadrants, each
                summarising a different aspect of the user's inner experience. Variables include what users see, hear,
                do
                and say and their psychological experiences. We added user gains and pain points at the bottom of the
                empathy map.
            </div>
            The empathy map helps us develop a more comprehensive understanding, including their emotional
            experiences, of our target users, thereby assisting us in better design ideation.

        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Design-Definition</h4>
            In the definition phase, we identify the core issues of our target users and create problem statements. We
            used the strategy and scope layers from the Elements of User Experience (Jesse James Garrett, 2002) as the
            framework for our problem statements and summarised our design concepts accordingly.

            After discussion, contemplation and design in the framework, we have summarised the definition of our
            product concept and system requirements:
            <div class="paraspace">
                "The system is a navigation-like system
                applied in traditional
                markets, aimed at providing an efficient, convenient, time-saving, and user-friendly solution for users
                who
                are unfamiliar with traditional markets to find their way. The system will attempt to improve the
                current
                environment and layout of traditional markets, promote user collaboration in a more friendly
                environment,
                and reduce the negative emotion of target users, thus enhancing the user experience."

        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Design-Ideation</h4>
            Our team conducted brainstorming during the ideation phase and created thumbnail sketches. We discussed our
            ideas in team meetings and tried to find feasible concepts that fit our design goals.

                Based on the careful consideration of course requirements, user needs, and feasibility, we have selected
                our
                solution as follows: <br>
                "Providing a shopping basket for all users with different colours representing their user type when the
                market layout is well-positioned. A white basket represents the target user unfamiliar with the market
                layout and may need help with navigation. A black basket represents the fringe user who is a regular
                customer in the traditional market and can assist the target user. These baskets will indicate the type
                of
                products the user needs to buy. When the target user needs help, they can quickly identify regular
                customers
                who can assist them by the colour of the basket and determine whether the regular customer has the same
                destination based on the indications. If their destination is the same, the target user can follow or
                ask
                the regular customer for help."
            </div>
            After finalising the initial design concept, we communicate with the teaching team and other groups to
            deepen and refine our design solution.

            We conducted a co-design workshop to demonstrate our ideas to others to obtain their opinions and unique
            perspectives on our design. We designed 4 activities to help us decide on valuable areas and suitable
            layouts in traditional markets.

        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Prototype</h4>
            To validate our design, we created a low-fidelity prototype for further user testing. Additionally, we also
            explored other methods, such as cardboard and 3D models, to allow us to verify and improve our ideas through
            rapid assessment and group reflection.
            <div class="inlinecenter">

            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">User Testing-Protocol</h4>
            In the test phase, we invited ten participants of different ages to experience how it feels in various roles
            in the system by playing the roles of regular and new customers. Seven of them are our target users, people
            who don't go to the traditional market very much (no more than once a month), aged between 25 and 38. The
            other three are our fringe users, people who often go to the traditional market (more than three times a
            week), aged between 38 and 60. The test site was selected in a medium-sized market of about 400 square
            metres in Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, China.
            <div class="paraspace">
                Layout optimisation requires a change in the layout of ample space, which is implemented in our current
                situation, so in our user test, we will focus on the test of the user experience of the iMarket system.
                In the test, we will artificially divide a specific market area into certain colour areas and inform the
                participants who are regular customers.
            </div>
            In each round of tests, one participant acts as a new customer and one as a regular customer. We will have a
            team member playing the role of a regular customer to ensure that each participant has not played a regular
            customer before playing a new customer, that is, to ensure they know nothing about regional distribution.
            The new customers will be asked to use the operation screen to select four areas required by the task and
            will be given four colour tags of different colours in their bags. And each regular customer's bag will have
            three colour tags of the same colour as the new customer's colour tags. The new customer must find two
            regular customers to complete the navigation task. During this period, regular customers walk around the
            traditional market and buy goods to simulate everyday market shopping.

        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">User Testing-Metric</h4>
            We use qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods in the test to evaluate our prototype.
            <div class="paraspace">
                For quantitative evaluation, we will use a scale and measurement method similar to SUS (System Usability
                Scale) to analyse and evaluate the degree to which the system promotes user collaboration. We will also
                roughly cover usability evaluation. We call this the CPS (Collaboration Promotion Scale).
            </div>
            <div class="paraspace">
                Our Collaboration Promotion Scale consists of eight questions, the responses to CPS are done on a scale
                of 1
                to 5, where 1 means strongly disagree and 5 means strongly agree. <br>Five of scale are designed to
                evaluate
                the
                promotion of collaboration between users, two to evaluate usability, and one to conduct an open
                assessment
                to inspire later interviews. Of the eight questions, there are five positive questions and three
                negative
                ones. When we deal with the raw data, we will convert the data according to the way SUS handles it
                (Sauro,
                2011).
            </div>
            <ul class="marketicon">
                <div class="bold">CPS scale</div>
                <li>I think I'd like to communicate with regular customers.</li>
                <li>I have no impulse to communicate with regular customers.</li>
                <li>I think it's easy to talk to regular customers.</li>
                <li>I think I need more encouragement to talk to regular customers.</li>
                <li>I think there is a friendly atmosphere among customers.</li>
                <li>I would love to use this system frequently.</li>
                <li>I think this system is very helpful to my shopping experience.</li>
                <li>I encountered difficulties in using the system.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="paraspace">
                For qualitative evaluation, we will observe and record the test process of the participants, conduct
                interviews for them at the end, record their feedback and analyse it.
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="introduction">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">User Testing-Quantitative Evaluation</h4>
            For CPS, we are using a similar method of SUS to convert the data to make sure the final data is neutral,
            and the higher the score is, the better the performance is. In the end, we have boxplots for each question
            to interpret.
            <img src="./Images2/IM-data1.png" alt="data processing-boxplots" class="imgofp img2">
            After analysing the data, the participants gave a relatively high evaluation of the usability of our system,
            indicating that our system had no obvious usability issues.
            <div class="paraspace">
                However, although the participants gained some collective experience in the evaluation of collaboration,
                it
                was still insufficient and did not fully satisfy them.
            </div>
            The results of communicating with regular customers reflected individual differences in the social
            experience of users with different personalities in our system, which significantly impacted their system
            experience.
            <div class="paraspace">
                Based on the scale, we can conclude that iMarket is a capable and usable user collaboration system.

            <h4 class="subtitleofp">User Testing-Qualitative Evaluation</h4>
            We recorded the users' behaviours during the testing process. And we further confirmed the data obtained
            from observation through interviews and collected data on users' experiences during the interviews.

            According to the evaluation of observations and interview data, the iMarket system promotes collaboration
            among traditional market customers, which was almost non-existent before the emergence of iMarket (novel).
            Additionally, iMarket does help to address the problem of user experience decline caused by poorly designed
            market layouts and navigation systems.
