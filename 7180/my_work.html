            This is a individual work. I use the Queensland government databse to create something creative and
            interactive.
            After the CONTACT discussion, information about data of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
            languages(Hereinafter referred to as aboriginal language)
            piqued my interest. As someone
            who enjoys literature, I can see how important words are to a culture. Therefore, using the data, something
            meaningful might be accomplished.<br>
            The data that I used are <span style="font-style: italic;">"State Library of Queensland - Aboriginal and
                Torres Strait Islander languages word lists | Datasets | data.gov.au – beta"</span> and
            <span style="font-style: italic;">"State Library of Queensland - Collection items in Aboriginal and Torres
                Strait Islander languages |
                Datasets | data.gov.au - beta"</span>.<br><br>
            My idea was inspired by language learning apps, and as the aboriginal language is also a language, why
            not try to make the data into a website like a language learning application. Only the aim of the site is
            not
            really to make the user learn the language but to make them aware of its existence. For every person who
            learns about a language, there is less chance of that language becoming endangered.<br><br>
            With this in mind, I have made my design after consulting related products.<br>

            relevant knowledge with pictures and texts while browsing.<br> And there will be interspersed storyboards to
            let
            readers understand the language and the history of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.

                    First of all, as a creative work, it is a bit too primitive. Many design details including the key
                    creative realization details are missing.<br><br>
                    On the other hand, as tutor’s feedback said, my idea lacks creativity, and it sounds like a
                    simple search and/or mapping system. I should explore the uses of these data more
                    creatively.<br><br>

            The idea of ​​this project came from the discussion in our group. At that time, we shared our 2A works, and
            then I found that there are two works in our group that can be combined together. <br><br>They are the
            prototypes of a
            map website and a review website. After discussing the idea of ​​combining the two creative ideas, we all
            agreed that our project could be turned into a review
            website in the form of a map display.<br>This website will be developed based on the data of food truck and
            the data of bus stops and ferry crossings location in the Queensland government database. This will be very
            interesting
            and more intuitive than other review
            sites.<br><br>Then, another team member proposed that we could create a review website for merchants. In
            this
            way, this website would be a business consultant. As soon as this idea was proposed, we all liked it very
            much. As a result, this site has changed from a review site to a consultant site for merchants and
            entrepreneurs.<br><br>After determining the theme of the website, we quickly determined our target user:
            s individual business owners who are running
            food trucks or planning to run those. The purpose of our website is to help target users find a store
            location that helps increase their sales. This is very meaningful because there is <a

                    Apart from the financial support provided by the government to bricks and mortar
                    food businesses, additional restrictions might bring adverse effects and potential
                    damage to the mobile food businesses. According to [1], Hobsons Bay City Council
                    in Melbourne’s west planned to release a new policy related to mobile vendors.
                    Under the restrictions, the food trucks business has to stay 500m from physical
                    restaurants. This action aims to protect the bricks and mortar food business to
                    reduce their risk of customer churn. Also, mobile food businesses might face an
                    annual permit fee of $12,000 to continue their operation. The negative
                    consequences behind the regulations are detrimental. Therefore, it is necessary to
                    assist business owners to minimise the loss and improve their performance.

                    Due to the global pandemic, repeated COVID-19 lockdowns damage businesses
                    across different industries. The restaurants in the food industry, which depend
                    significantly on traffic, cannot earn as much money as before the COVID-19 [1]. In
                    NSW, the statistics show around $21 million worth of requests for financial support
                    were sent on Saturday alone, with more than 60,000 businesses waiting for their
                    applications to be processed [2]. Small food businesses are hard to maintain
                    business during downturns. The main reason behind this is that there is less chance
                    for people to hang out with their friends and family, so the business’s daily
                    expenditure on the rent and operating costs is overwhelming. Therefore, enterprise
                    transformation is crucial for the business to survive during unexpected
                    circumstances. According to the news published by SBS Your Language [3], as an
                    alternative business model, food trucks have started to be well known in the food
                    industry. With the increases in the food truck businesses, intensive competition
                    between companies is unavoidable. To assist foresighted businesses who are eager
                    to stand out, it is better to support them in the way the government could not.

            After that, we also discussed the preliminary interactive

            functions and workflow.<br>We divide the interface into exploration mode and recommendation mode according
            to its main functions. In the exploration mode, users can interact with the map by themselves. We will
            display the data obtained from the database on the map to assist users in their judgment. In the
            recommendation mode, we will use our algorithm to recommend a location suitable for the user to open a
            store.<br><br>

            proposal.

            Peiying and Zhongyu
            completed the initial construction of the website.

                    This is the first time I am working on a team project with such a long time and such a heavy
                    workload. In team discussions, it is often difficult for me to keep up with the ideas of the team
                    members. I can only immerse myself in my own thoughts and throw out some ideas from time to time,
                    which may disrupt the team's thinking. But thank you my teammates for willing to listen to my
                    thoughts. <br>Later, when working on a team project, I should always record the handwriting to sort
                    out
                    the progress of the meeting and record the team's thoughts. <br>In the subsequent development, it
                    proved
                    that our previous discussions and development work were very well in place. There were basically no
                    fundamental changes in the later period. So a project should have the order of creativity-demand
                    research-interaction design-development to develop.

            <h3 style="margin-top: 8%;">2D Work-in-Progress Milestone (What did we do)</h3>
            We follow the previous division of labor, Lujia, Juewen and I are responsible for the interaction design.
            According to the results of previous work, I propose to make the interactive elements of the website
            floating, and then use an interactive map
            as the background. This can make the website more modern and also give users an immersive browsing
            experience. After they unified my ideas, we started to make prototypes. In the process of prototyping,
            Juewen
            suggested that we design a logo. So I took charge of the logo design and completed it alone. I only modified
            the color scheme and
            icon transparency of the exploration and recommendation mode interface in the prototype after the prototype
            was completed to make it more in line with my original vision.<br><br>
            In the logo design, I have been thinking about how to combine the theme food truck of our group with the
            name of our website millionaire assistant. <br>The first thing I thought of was the food truck's
            representative
            food hot dog and the money associated with millionaires. So I tried to combine hot dogs with money, using a
            wad of money to replace hot dog sausages. The effect is very good.<br>After consulting the team members, the
            feedback received was that only one hot dog was slightly simple.<br><br> So I thought that complex logos
            usually
            have portraits or graphics. So I took a popular meme picture in China as inspiration, extracted a black and
            white picture, and drew a new logo. Eventually, this logo will appear in the upper left corner of each page
            of the website!

                    The design of the logo is full of challenges. A recognizable logo is an essential part of expressing
                    the brand of a website. I am thrilled that I can take on such an important job. and I hope this logo
                    can reflect the purpose of our website to help users make a lot of money through food. <br>Judging
                    from
                    the
                    feedback from the team members, I did a good job. But unfortunately, this resulted in me not having
                    time to participate in the interactive interface design deeply. But I believe that the changes I
                    made will improve the user experience of the site.

            <h3 style="margin-top: 8%;">2E Final Delivery (What we ended up doing)</h3>
            For the rest of the time, we build our website according to the prototype. We encountered changes to our
            prototype in the middle because the database was no longer maintained, and there was too little data to
            write a perfect algorithm. Therefore, we weakened the weight of the recommendation mode. <br>We integrated
            the
            original exploration and recommendation modes into one page and made the remaining pages a food truck list.
            At this stage, my job is to develop this list.<br><br>
            As a PHP beginner (also Html, CSS and JavaScript beginner), I mainly refer to the Week 5 workshop to
            complete this part of the construction. During this period, I encountered many difficulties. I cannot
            understand the most basic methods and variables. I will read Week 5's solution while googling. After
            understanding the solution code,I tried to extract the code that gets data from JSON and generate HTML
            code to list it.<br>
            The first difficult is to change the code for connecting data because the data type used in solution is CSV
            and what we used is json. I had to comment
            some code then check the website work situation to test the code is it mean to me. The connection is a bit
            different. <br>
            Then I encountered the difficult correctly using jquery get the data form json.
            The image data was stroage as the formats <span style="font-style: italic;">"'img':{"src":,"alt":}"</span>.
            I
            tried recordValue ["avater:src"/"avater/src"] but they don't work. I used "p" tag to check what I got from
            data and it was error. After thinking and various attempt, I take two steps to get data as the first slide
            shows and it work.<br>
            The another difficulty to me is using the embed structure(See the second slide) to put some text in the "a"
            tag to make the link
            accessible.After thinking and attempt it finally works(Unfortunately, this feature was deleted in the final
            stage based on test feedback).
            <br><br>
            After the five of us worked together for a semester, the website was finally presented at the tradeshow. You
            can also access it through the link: <a href="https://numbat.uqcloud.net"

                    Programming is difficult for beginners. But with the help of abundant learning resources, basic
                    problems can still be solved. Maybe next time, I should learn the related thing earlier instead of
                    temporary cramming when I need it. This time, the programming has improved my debugging ability, and
                    I learn I can debug by
                    comments or simple output assignments when needed.

            Folio is a record of a designer's design career and a reflection of his or her abilities. For this course, I
            would like to see this website you are browsing as a record of my learning process and a collection of
            learning
            insights for this course. I hope that through this website, I can document my growth and also reflect my
            ability and competence.
            Therefore, I try to use a simple design to highlight the content. In order to avoid monotony and keep the
            page vivid, add some dynamic elements and colors to the page. The colors of the entire website are chosen
            around the three primary colors of red, green and blue. It implies that just like these three primitive
            colors can collide to create countless colors, I can also gain countless knowledge from a simple learning
            process, and
            I can grow from a beginner to a capable person.<br>
            In terms of function, I added a sidebar to facilitate users to switch between multiple pages. At the same
            time, the pop-up window function is used to make the page simple without causing low information density.
            Also, it
            provides interaction for the page. It can make the page content in various forms, so users
            cannot easily feel bored.

                    Time is in a hurry. Even I did a prototype design before development, I still felt that there
                    was a lack of design in the development. In the subsequent prototypes, do as many user tests as
                    possible, involving every page and function.
