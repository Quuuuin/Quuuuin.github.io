            Hi, I'm Wanqwi Yang. I am studying for a Masters in Interaction Design at the University of Queensland. I
            studied mechanical engineering as an undergraduate and it was a difficult but enthusiastic venture into a
            new field.<br><br> In my spare time, I love design, games and art. The design process is a time to let my
            imagination run wild. Programming is challenging but seeing a website built little by little according to a
            prototype gives you a sense of achievement.<br><br>Here, you will see my work, the record of the process and
            my
            reflection on the project&#46
            <br><br>
