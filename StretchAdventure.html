            Stretch Adventure is a motion-sensing game designed for people who need to work long hours in front of a
            desk. Improper computer use, including long hours of uninterrupted computer use, can lead to muscle and
            joint pain. Stretch Adventure uses common wearable devices such as smart bands or smart watches with the
            computer to guide users to stretch through motion-sensing games to relax their muscles.

        <section class="introduction firstsentence">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">The background & Research</h4>
            Stretch Adventure is a well-thought-out and researched idea under the course theme: <span
                class="underline">A Game Augmenting Everyday
                Life</span>. It aims to improve office workers' happiness and physical health, helping them have a more
            fulfilling
            workday.
            <div class="paraspace">
                Through literature review, survey, and interviews, I comprehensively understood the problem space and
                studied feasibility. Based on the literature review, I created a questionnaire, distributed it on Google
                Forms and received 89 valid responses. Three open-ended interviews were conducted to address the key
                findings from the questionnaire analysis.
            </div>
            <div class="arrowframe">
                <img src="./Images/arrow.png" alt="decorated arrow" class="deco1">
                <img src="./Images/SAsurveydata.png" alt="Bar chart of one of the data" class="imgofp img2 imgfloat">
            </div>
            Through exploration of the problem space, my data analysis shows that a large proportion of office workers
            experience self-reported upper limb muscle fatigue issues. There is a demand for muscle relaxation, but the
            current conditions are insufficient to support and encourage them to engage in muscle relaxation during
            their leisure time at work. And a large portion of them lacks relevant knowledge about muscle relaxation.
            <div class="paraspace">
                According to the survey results, Stretch Adventure is positioned as a system that encourages and
                guides the users to perform muscle relaxation in limited circumstances.
            </div>

        <section class="introduction firstsentence">
            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Conceptual Design</h4>
            Stretch Adventure is a somatosensory game designed to alleviate the strains and pains of prolonged desk
            work.
            <div class="paraspace">
                The target user for the game is young white-collar workers in office buildings. They are interested in
                new technology and also pay attention to health management. They are often willing to invest in their
                physical fitness; many of them own or are interested in purchasing wearable devices such as smartwatches
                or fitness trackers.
            </div>
            The game is designed to use sensors on wearable devices to guide target users to finish simple
            stretches. By completing a set of stretching exercises to pass a game level, I hope the design can enhance
            the user's sense of achievement and cultivate the user's stretching habits.The design hope to give users
            physical relief and mental relaxation by allowing them to stretch through a
            fun game.

                <span class="italic">The scene's width</span>: In my test, I usually need 2-4s to change from one

                to the following.
            </div>
            <span class="italic">The length of the scene</span>: THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA recommends people take
            a
            five or ten minutes break to do a series of stretches after sitting a long time at a desk or computer
            terminal.
            <div class="paraspace">
                <span class="italic">The number of coins</span>: According to research, holding the stretch for 20
                seconds
                is reasonable. In future development, 20 seconds will be taken as the standard to consider the placement
                of
                coins.
            </div>
            <span class="bold" id="usertest">-User Test</span>
            <div class="paraspace">
                For usability testing, I used an interview format to ask testers about their feelings and suggestions
                for the game after they played it.
            </div>
            Besides demonstrating the prototype's usability, the purpose of testing is to prove its effectiveness in
            addressing design opportunities in the problem space. Our game has two objectives: muscle relaxation and
            mental relaxation, so I designed two evaluation methods for the test.
            <div class="paraspace">
                For the muscle relaxation effect,
                instruments used to evaluate muscle tension are expensive or require professional knowledge. After
                considering and referring to the literature (Bhimani et al., 2017), I used <span class="underline">a
                    self-rating scale</span>.
                Participants use different adjectives to describe their physical sensations before and after playing the
                game.
            </div>
            <div class="paraspace">
                For the mental relaxation effect, I used the <span class="underline">SAS (Self-Rating Anxiety
                    Scale)</span>
                to evaluate, which is
                widely used in the field of psychology to measure individuals' mental stress (Dunstan & Scott, 2020).
            </div>
            <span class="bold">-Evaluation</span>
            <div class="paraspace">
                I invited 9 testers to participate in the whole testing process, including the experience and interview.
                Through the interviews, the testers evaluated the interface's usability, the completeness of the game
                functions, and the effectiveness of the design. I summarized their data after the interviews.
            </div>
            <img src="./Images/SAdata2.png" alt="Interview data" class="imgofp img2">
            <span class="bold">-Muscle self-rating and SAS(Self-Rating Anxiety

            <img src="./Images/SAdata3.png" alt="Muscle self-rating and SAS(Self-Rating Anxiety

            <span class="bold">-Muscle self-rating and SAS(Self-Rating Anxiety
                Scale) Visualization: After the game</span>

            Scale) Visualization: After the game" class="imgofp img2">
            By comparing the word clouds before and after the test, it can be found that the overall muscle tension of
            the testers has decreased by one level. The main feeling has changed from "stiff" to "good". Therefore, this
            game does help people to relax their bodies by guiding them to do some practical stretching exercises. This
            result is consistent with the widely recognized fact that stretching can relieve muscle fatigue.
            <div class="paraspace">
                However, in evaluating the mental relaxation scale, only one tester's data has changed, which can be
                considered to have almost no significant effect.
            </div>
            By comparing data before and after the test, we can conclude that the game <span class="underline">has an
                effect on muscle
                relaxation, but its impact on mental relaxation is limited</span>. I think this is because muscle
            relaxation
            mainly depends on stretching, and the prototype has already implemented the main functions related to
            stretching. However, mental relaxation depends on the influence of muscle relaxation and the missing
            game graphics and sound effects in the current prototype. The lack of motivation for passing the game
            also leads to a poor effect on mental relaxation.

                as the previous phrase in this test phrase. I will conduct two rounds of
                testing this time. The first round of testing will have no background music to compare whether the
                extended stretching time has improved the results. The second round will include background music to
                test whether adding background music positively affects mental relaxation mainly. <br>*Both rounds of
                testing
                will control variables to ensure valid results.

            <div class="paraspace">
                A total of nine participants took part in the test. Here is the interview data.

            <img src="./Images/SAdata8.png" alt="SAS(Self-Rating Anxiety
            Scale) Visualization: After the game with background music" class="imgofp img2">
            Comparing the two tests found that the degree and frequency of the vocabulary used by the testers for
            description were similar before the tests, which can be regarded as the exact prerequisite for the two
            tests. After the tests, compared to the previous test, although "stiff" and "dull" still appeared in this
            test, the frequency of occurrence decreased. At the same time, the frequency of "relax" increased
            significantly.
            <div class="paraspace">
                This result is consistent with the widely accepted view that stretching can relieve muscle
                fatigue. It can be considered that extending the game time did increase the relaxation effect.
                It is foreseeable that within the stretching time recommended by the authority, the stretching effect
                will increase as the stretching time increases. Therefore, as long as the time is extended to the
                recommended time, the game will have an optimised effect.
            </div>
            Regarding mental relaxation, the improved prototype without background music is slightly better than the
            previous prototype. Still, the difference is insignificant, indicating that the prerequisites of the tests
            are consistent.
            <div class="paraspace">
                Based on the result, the prototype with added background music is more effective than the
                one without. The number of testers in the 35-45 score group has decreased significantly. The number in
                the 65-75 score group has increased considerably, indicating that <span class="underline">the testers'
                    mental pressure has been
                    effectively relieved</span>.
            </div>
            Therefore, it can be considered that adding background music can indeed enhance the
            relaxing effect of the game on people's mental state. With the refinement of art resources and reward
            mechanisms, the effect of mental relaxation will likely be further improved.

            <h4 class="subtitleofp">Prototyping - Accessibility Reflection</h4>
            The target user with accessibility needs is the colour-blind user. Colour-blind people usually cannot
            distinguish between specific colours. It will cause the information presented through colour can be
            unreadable or completely invisible, friendly players can look like enemies, and game elements can become
            camouflaged against each other in the game.
            <div class="paraspace">
                As many as 8 per cent of men and 0.4 per cent of women
                experience congenital colour deficiency(Chan et al., 2014). It means that the colour-blind group has
                this
                non-negligible proportion among gamers, and colour blindness does interfere with the game experience.
            </div>
            <div class="paraspace">
                Unlike other accessibility needs like those who lose of limb, which requires a complete redesign of game
                content or who are blind that may conflict with the game's original intention (a visual incentive game),
                the colour
                blind people are already on the target list. And the game can meet its accessibility needs with a
                limited redesign.
            </div>
            <span class="bold">-Design Guideline</span>
            <div class="paraspace">
                After browsing the websites of many organisations dedicated to game accessibility and referring to WCAG
                (Web
                Content Accessibility Guidelines)2.1 related colour design guidelines, I summarised a set of colour
                barrier
                design guidelines to check any unfriendly design for colour-blind players and use it as a guide for game
                development in the future.
            </div>
            <div class="paraspace">
                <ul class="sticon">
                    <li>Ensure no essential information is conveyed by a fixed colour alone. Considering the extreme
                        situation like Monochromacy, it is best to provide text instead of colour to convey information
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure the contrast ratio is over 3:1 because some colours may appear darker than without colour
                        deficiency. It makes the game object distinguishable from everything else in the game.</li>
                    <li>Ideally, players can select and customise colours for vital information (colour blindness mode).
                        If not possible, include a simple colour palette that can be used as a single-colour choice that
                        is not problematic for those with colour blindness.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <span class="bold">-User Test</span>
            <div class="paraspace">
                Due to the tight development schedule, it was challenging to access colour-blind patients for data
                collection. I conducted accessibility testing of the game interface through a colour-blindness simulator
                and got the literature's help.
            </div>
            <img src="./Images/SAdata9.png" alt="Game scene in the colour-blindness simulator" class="imgofp img2">
            <img src="./Images/SAdata11.png" alt="Color palette summary for colorblind users" class="imgofp img2">
            For a long time, artists and designers have believed that colours can significantly influence emotions,
            feelings, and moods and have developed what is known as <span class="underline">colour psychology</span>
            (Elliot & Maier, 2014). The
            colour-blind players may be affected by the abnormal colours they see, which could reduce the game's
            relaxation effect.
            <div class="paraspace">
                Researchers and experts have made some significant findings on the impact of colour
                psychology on emotions, feelings, and behaviours. Colours in the red spectrum are called warm colours.
                These
                warm colours evoke emotions ranging from warmth and comfort to anger and hostility (O'Connor, 2011). My
                previous simulation test showed that the vision of green-blind users was all in red. <span
                    class="underline">Prolonged exposure
                    to
                    red light may make green-blind users feel less relaxed</span>. To solve this problem, I tried
                various colours
                in
                the redesign. I put the redesign plan into the simulator to verify the design.
