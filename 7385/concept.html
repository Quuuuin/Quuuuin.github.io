        <h3>Ideation & Define</h3>
        <section>The theme of our team Flash Studio is Expressible, and the official introduction of Expressible is
            "Merge of
            Neo-Fashion and Expressions of Self; &nbsp
            Worn items for self-expression;&nbsp
            Changeable/adaptable fashion;&nbsp
            Enhances / augmented worn garments;
            ", which actually gives us a lot of
            inspiration, plus this year's theme of DECO3850/7385 is Near-future Mundane. This leads us to imagine the
            innovation that
            can be accommodated in clothes in the near future.
        </section>
        <section>
            In the thousands of years or even tens of thousands of years before the birth of clothing, clothing has
            evolved from a single function of keeping us warm and providing us relatively protection to an important
            part
            of cultural and social life.
            Clothing is the external projection of our inner self-image, is our first social interface. It links our
            external image with our social identity and has an important social impact. At the same time, individuals
            use clothes to strengthen their emotions and express their feelings, reflecting their self-identity and
            material practice <nobr class="intextref">(Kod≈æoman, 2019)</nobr>.
        </section>
        <section>
            Therefore, clothing is the design carrier that we have identified from the very beginning. When we
            brainstorm about Expressible, we focus on how to give more features to clothes in the near future.

            In today's digital age, clothing, as a personal item for each of us, is rarely equipped with
            digital technology. So after brainstorming, we decided to design next-generation clothes with the use of
            digital technology.
        </section>
        <h3> Intended Concept & Ideal Experience</h3>
        <section>
            We named our concept product Mark II-VII, which was inspired by the name of Iron Man's armor. Because our
            product can bring about interactions that none of the previous clothes can do through the
            application of digital technology, through the new interaction possibilities brought about by this digital
            technology to explore a new level of self-expression. This dynamic clothing is consistent with Iron Man's
            deformable armor, and we hope to convey the dynamic design concept to our target users.
        </section>
        <section>
            While fashion is a universal form of self-expression regardless of demographic, the MARK II-VII would be
            great for socially concerned young adults born between 1995 and 2010 (referred to as Generation Z)<nobr
                class="intextref">(From
                <a href="./mywork.html#Re">Proposal Report</a>)
            </nobr>.
            But as a concept designed for daily life in the near future, with GenZ as a breakthrough and popularization,
            our vision is to extend our target users to year-round users.
        </section>
        <section>
            In our ideal plan, we will use flexible OLED as the material of MarkII-VII, flexible OLED can make
            electronic displays foldable, showing the characteristics of cloth, and fabric-based
            OLED displays have emerged for wearable devices.

            MarkII-VII will use flexible OLED instead of textile materials for manufacturing. MarkII-VII has a variety
            of shapes for users to choose. Users can choose winbreaker, jacket, T-shirt, skirt or bottoms.
            Users can buy different shape to match, the selling point is that the pattern on the clothes can be changed
            at
            any time. At the same time,
            MarkII-VII will also be equipped with infrared sensors, distance sensors, heart rate sensors, motion
            sensors, Bluetooth, WiFi, cellular data network modules and other sensors and connection hardware, as well
            as corresponding computing chips. Through the arrangement of sensors, MarkII-VII can interact by detecting
            the surrounding environment and the state of the user. At the same time, the use of WiFi, Bluetooth
            and cellular data network allows Mark series clothing to connect to each other or remotely through the
            server,
            which can give clothes more imagination of social value and interaction possibility.
        </section>
        <section>
            Because the entire MarkII-VII is made of a display screen, its patterns and colour are no longer static
            and immutable. Users can change the patterns and colours of MarkII-VII anytime and anywhere through relevant
            applications or websites on mobile phones, computers or other devices. At the same time, the patterns and
            colours
            is no longer static, but like the dynamic wallpaper on the computer and mobile phone, it can change with
            time, surrounding, and user status. The real-time modification of patterns and the implementation of dynamic
            patterns are realized through the practical application of sensors and connection technology.

            The patterns on MarkII-VII can be patterns brought from online market created by artists or from users'
            self-creation.In order to show their own uniqueness, users can also use fingerprint sensors
            or
            3D face recognition, which are commonly equipped on mobile phones and computers, to generate
            user-specific and never repeated exclusive patterns through their unique personal biometric by our
            special encryption algorithm. This exclusive pattern can make clothes unique and enhance the social value
            brought by uniqueness.
        </section>
        <section>
            We call these unique or copyrighted designs TOKENs. At the same time, we introduce the emerging concept of
            NFT
            (Non-fungible token), which gives each pattern uniqueness and claim ownership through blockchain.
        </section>
        <section>
            By using NFT tokens, users can guarantee the ownership and specificity of the pattern, turn the patterns
            into
            a certified digital asset, and retain the social and identity value of the clothing.
            With the help of the concept of NFT, the pattern can also become a tradable digital asset. Through the NFT
            trading platform, users can trade tokens. Every time a user buys a new token means this new piece of
            clothing, which can greatly prolong the life cycle of MarkII-VII, effectively occupying the living space of
            fast fashion. the living
            space of fast fashion. Fast fashion is an unsustainable and unethical industrial model, which makes profits
            by rapidly iterating cheap and low-quality clothes, resulting in waste. Also,
            its production process also brings problems of environmental pollution and labour welfare <nobr

        <section>
            Through the NFT trading, users may have a large number of tokens. Mark II-VII can automatically activate
            different
            tokens under various circumstances through the user's setting. For example, the user can set a colourful
            dynamic
            pattern to be activated when running, and Mark II-VII will automatically switch when the motion sensor
            detects that the user
            is engaged in intense exercise.
            We also created the interaction between users. When two Mark users' communicative actions are detected by
            sensors, such as shaking hands, hugging or greeting, the patterns of the two will impermanently merge
            according to
            a set of algorithms by NFC(Near-field communication) communication, which can enhance the social connection
            between users and make clothes play a greater
            role in social situations.
        </section>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <section>
            At the conceptual stage, our definition of MarkII-VII and the design scenario is entirely for the near
            future mundane. Through the
            introduction of digital technology, we give clothes novel and brand-new interaction ways. The
            function of MarkII-VII will fully serve the embodiment of self-expression and social functions,
            without any practical functions. When I started brainstorming by myself, the idea of create a new
            interaction for clothes
            first came to my mind. But how to give feedback about interaction, as a self-expression instrument, it must
            be able to
            affect the people and the environment around it. I have considered the vibration and the changes of
            clothes' shape, but none of them is as direct and eye-catching as the use of light.
            Fortunately, my teammates accepted my idea and improved it in this way, by adding user interaction and
            NFT's token concept. I think the addition of these two functions is wonderful and excellent. The
            addition of these two functions gives clothes new possibilities on top of self-expression that cannot be
            realized before digital technology is added to clothes. At the same time, these two functions can even be
            extended to the field of the Internet of things, greatly broadening the imaginative boundary of clothing
            functions.

            This brand-new digital fashion expression is an innovation of traditional clothing. This non-static design
            allows our users to update their outfit appearance at any time. This self-image renewal does not rely on
            the replacement of physical clothing syle, which greatly reduces the waste caused by the fashion
            industry and consumerism, but not at the cost of suppressing people's desire for self-expression. This is a
            response to our definition of two problem spaces: self-expression and environmentally friendly. At the same
            time, the new interaction on clothes also greatly strengthens and emphasizes the social attributes of
            clothes. Another innovation in self-expression is the design of the NFT
            token system. Through the declaration of the uniqueness and ownership of the pattern by NFT, it gives the
            uniqueness and asset value of the pattern. Each person is unique, and each person's mind is unique, which
            gives
            each of us a unique personality, self-expression is the appearance of personality. The unique pattern of
            MarkII-VII satisfies the expression of self-unique personality.
            Another selling point of our design is the free tokens trading, which is a function with a lot of
            room for development. A fully formed transaction ecology can even revolutionize the clothing purchase
            experience.
        </section>
        <section>
            For the design of the concept, we have carried on the wild creativity according to the background of the
            near future. But at this stage, we did not consider the feasibility and how to implement the functions of
            the prototype. The lack of feasibility analysis leads to a large gap between our prototype products and
            concepts, like the token trading system, which is very hard to implement in prototype stage. At
            this stage, we should conceive how our creativity should be presented through the prototype to convey our
            design intention.
